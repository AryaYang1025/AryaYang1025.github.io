    <p>I'm Arya. The key pitch title of my project is Dream World. The theme of my project is to collect various dream types and to share some musics, websites, etc. about dreams. My target audience is people who have questions about dreams and want to understand the dream world, or who are interested in the dream world.
      The guiding principles are creativity and imagination. Dreams require imagination and creativity. These are very important because it allows people to enter a different world and push boundaries. It can also make people more involved in this dream world. </p>
